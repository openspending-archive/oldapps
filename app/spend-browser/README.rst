This is a mini-app to demonstrate how to create a Spending Browser using the
OpenSpending API and OpenSpending javascript library.


Instructions for Using in Your Own App
======================================

See index.html as an example.

Note on Absolute Pathes
-----------------------

Replace local paths for scripts and css in index.html with::

  http://bitbucket.org/okfn/openspendingjs/raw/tip/{path-in-openspendingjs-repo}

For example a path to::

  ../../lib/vendor/ajax-solr/core/Core.js

Should become::

  http://bitbucket.org/okfn/openspendingjs/raw/tip/lib/vendor/ajax-solr/core/Core.js

A path::

  js/search.js

Should become::

  http://bitbucket.org/okfn/openspendingjs/raw/tip/app/spend-browser/js/search.js
